description: "Finds YouTube and podcast moments where a person says something or a topic comes up, gives the verbatim quote with a timestamped link, and, when a shell is available, cuts each moment into a clip between words with its source logged. Use for 'find clips of X saying Y', quotes or footage for an edit or hype reel, a quote cut from a podcast or interview, or downloading a reference reel from TikTok, Instagram, X or YouTube to study or remake. Searches by speaker with the Arcmira MCP server when it is connected."

# Find YouTube clips and quotes

You turn "I need X saying Y" into moments the user can check: the exact words, who said them, where, and a clip that starts and ends between words.

Run every command from the user's project folder. `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is this skill's folder; outside Claude Code, use the path of the folder that holds this file. Clips and `clips/clips.json` land in the project, never in the skill folder, and `pull.mjs` refuses to write there.

## Output contract

Every moment you hand over has:

- The verbatim words, quoted from transcript lines, never tidied.
- Speaker, show, episode title, date and the `watch_url` that starts at the moment.
- A clip start and end in source seconds.
- With a shell: `clips/<name>/clip.mp4`, `info.json`, `sheet.jpg`, and a row in `clips/clips.json`. The row is the credit and the way back to the source. Keep media out of git. Add `clips/*/clip.mp4` and `clips/*/info.json` to `.gitignore` before the first commit.

## Before the first moment

Check once, and tell the user what is missing:

- **Arcmira.** The plugin this skill ships in registers the Arcmira MCP server. If `arcmira_describe` is not among your tools, or a call says to sign in, ask the user to run `/mcp`, pick arcmira and sign in. That opens arcmira.com in the browser, and a Free account works. Without the plugin, the command is `claude mcp add --scope user --transport http arcmira https://mcp.arcmira.com/mcp`, then `/mcp`. Other hosts are listed at https://arcmira.com/docs/mcp-server. With `ARCMIRA_API_KEY` set, the REST calls in `references/arcmira.md` work instead. Without any of these you can still cut by URL and search YouTube by title.
- Call `arcmira_describe` once before the first program. It returns the current client API: methods, parameter names, worked programs and error codes. The program below was written against it on 2026-10-17. If a method or field it uses (for example `speakerIds`) is missing or named differently in the description, follow the description.
- **Cutting tools.** `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, Node 20 or newer, and `uv`, which runs the pinned yt-dlp. If one is missing, give the user the install command (`brew install ffmpeg node uv` on a Mac) and let them run it. Never pipe a downloaded script into a shell. No shell means you stop at links and seconds.

## Pick the path

1. **The user gave a URL.** Look first with `node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pull.mjs" <url> --probe`. It prints the length and rough download size and downloads nothing. Then cut a span with `--from` and `--to` in source seconds. A whole video over 10 minutes downloads only with `--whole`, so before you pass it, tell the user the length and size and wait for a yes. A reference reel to study or rebuild comes in whole this way.
2. **A person saying something.** Run the program below with `arcmira_execute_read`, then cut the best spans. `references/arcmira.md` has the same calls over REST, with a worked example.
3. **Footage of a person or thing doing something** (on stage, holding a chip, a crowd reacting). Words will not find it. Find candidate videos with `arcmira.mentions` (appearances: `is_appearance`) for interviews and talks, or with `node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pull.mjs" "ytsearch10:<query>" --probe` for everything else. Pull short spans and judge them from the contact sheets.

4. **Not in the index.** Arcmira has no hit for a video you know exists, because the user named it or a web search turned it up. Cut it by URL as in path 1, and log how it was found with `--found '{"via":"web-search","note":"<what pointed to it>"}'` (or `"via":"url"` when the user gave the link). Then tell the user Arcmira can add it. With their yes, send one `arcmira_feedback` that names the link, the channel and what they need from it, for example "Please index NVIDIA's channel. I need Jensen Huang's GTC 2026 keynote searchable by speaker." The more specific the ask, the better, and a whole channel is the most useful thing to ask for.

## The program

Pass this to `arcmira_execute_read`. Set `NAME` to the person, `CONTEXT` to the user's own words about them (or `null`), and `QUERY` to one topic. It returns one of three answers.

- `moments`: the hits. Each has the speaker's own lines, the transcript window around them, and the YouTube link to cut. `found` is the search to log with `--found`.
- `ask`: the name fits several people. Show `ask.options`, then rerun with `ID` and `NAME` set to the picked option's `id` and `name`.
- `not_in_index`: Arcmira has no such person. Say so, and offer path 3.

```javascript
const NAME = "Dylan Patel", CONTEXT = "SemiAnalysis", ID = null, QUERY = "TSMC", DAYS = 365;
const r = ID ? null : await arcmira.resolve(NAME, { type: "person", ...(CONTEXT ? { context: CONTEXT } : {}) });
const e = r && (r.best ?? r.suggested);
if (r && !e) return r.ask ? { ask: r.ask } : { not_in_index: NAME, note: r.note ?? null };
const id = ID ?? e.id;
const input = { query: QUERY, speakerIds: [id], after: arcmira.daysAgo(DAYS), limit: 5 };
const hits = await arcmira.search(input);
const who = hits.filters?.by?.find((b) => b.id === id)?.name ?? e?.name ?? NAME;
// A missing transcript is a state to report. Anything else, such as quota_exceeded, stops the program with its unlock link.
const SOFT = ["transcript_unavailable", "transcript_fetching"];
const out = [];
for (const c of hits.chunks) {
  const own = c.text.split("\n").filter((l) => l.startsWith(`${who}: `));
  if (!own.length) continue;
  const t = await arcmira.transcript(c.video_id, { start: Math.max(0, c.start_seconds - 5), end: c.start_seconds + 25 })
    .catch((err) => { if (SOFT.includes(err.code)) return { state: err.code }; throw err; });
  out.push({ episode: c.video_title, show: c.channel_name, date: c.published_at, watch_url: c.watch_url,
    youtube: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${c.video_id}`, at: c.start_seconds, own,
    lines: t.state === "ready" ? t.lines.map((l) => [l.start, l.end, l.text]) : t.state });
}
return { speaker: { id, name: who, assumed: Boolean(r?.suggested), why: r?.suggested?.evidence ?? null }, as_of: hits.as_of,
  found: { call: "search", input }, ...(out.length ? { moments: out } : { none: hits.note ?? null }) };
```

- Search one topic or phrase per call. For hype lines, use short concrete words the person says with energy: a company, a number, a claim. Add topics rather than raising `limit`.
- A `speakerIds` search can come back empty because speaker labels cover part of the index. Read `note`, then try `about` with the same id for what others said about them, or `mentions` for their appearances, before saying they never said it.
- Read the episode title before trusting a hit. A name can match a different person.
- When `speaker.assumed` is true, tell the user which person you assumed and why.

## Cut and check

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pull.mjs" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>" --from <start> --to <end> --name <slug> \
  --used audio+video --speaker "Dylan Patel" --found '{"call":"search","input":{"query":"nvidia","speakerIds":["ent_140776"],"after":"2024-01-01","limit":5}}'
```

- **Record how you found it.** Pass the `found` the program returned as `--found`, with its input exactly as the call took it, ids included. A call means `via: arcmira`. Use `{"via": "url"}` for a clip the user handed you, or leave `--found` out for one found by hand. If the hit was in another upload of the same talk than the one you cut, add `"in": "<that url>"`. Pass `--used audio`, `video` or `audio+video` for what the edit takes from the clip, and `--speaker` with the person's name, which becomes the clip's title on its recipe page. Never put an email or a local path in the input, because the recipe is public. The recipe writes these straight into the published entry, so a reader can rerun the search.

- `watch_url` opens Arcmira's player, with the transcript and speakers beside the moment. It is the link to share. Give `pull.mjs` the `youtube` link.
- **Transcript times are not cut points.** Caption lines start mid-phrase and run up to 0.4 s off. Put the in and out points inside a reported `speech_gaps` silence. Gap times are clip seconds, so source second = `source_seconds[0]` + gap.
- **Look before you use.** Open `sheet.jpg`. On a podcast the camera is often on the host while your speaker talks. Reject a clip whose frames do not show what the edit needs.
- **Pull short.** A span plus 0.5 s of padding downloads in seconds. A whole three-hour episode takes minutes and gigabytes.
- **Log every clip.** `pull.mjs` appends the URL, title, uploader, the cut you asked for, the padded source seconds, `used` and `found` to `clips/clips.json`. Keep the Arcmira speaker id and quote beside it when you have them.
- **Rights are the user's call.** Say once that reposting sports, film or creator footage publicly carries copyright risk.

## Credits

Every Arcmira read uses credits from the user's plan. Tell the user the scale before you start.

- A search uses 4 credits per passage past the first 5. The program keeps `limit` at 5, so its search uses none. At `limit: 20` one search can use 60.
- A captions transcript read uses 4 credits per started 15 minutes of its `start` to `end` window, so always pass a window. The program reads up to five 30-second windows, so one run uses at most 20 credits.
- For scale, the Dylan Patel reel ran 51 searches, 19 of them at `limit: 20`, for an estimated 1,000 credits, most of it from the wide searches.
- A Premium read (`quality: "premium"`, diarized and better spelled) uses 300 credits per started 15 minutes of the whole video. Use it only when the user asks, and price it first with `arcmira.quote(video)`, which is free.
- On the Free plan the newest 30 days are not served. A search whose window starts inside them is refused with `freshness_requires_paid`. Tell the user once, and search a window that starts earlier.
- A blocked read throws a code such as `quota_exceeded` with an `unlock` link. Pass the link on and stop.

## When a download fails

1. An old yt-dlp is the usual cause. `pull.mjs` runs the stable release pinned in `YTDLP_VERSION` (default `2026.8.19`) and freezes its dependencies to the days around that release. Check https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases, pick the newest stable release (not a nightly) that is at least a day old, and set `YTDLP_VERSION` to it.
2. TikTok and Instagram often refuse plain requests. `pull.mjs` already passes `--impersonate chrome` for them. A login wall needs `--cookies-from-browser <browser>`, and only with the user's agreement.
3. A 403 on a stream URL means fetch the page again. Do not retry the old URL.

## Next

For a reel built from these clips, the `aimv-recreate-reference-edit` and `aimv-repurpose` skills take `clips/clips.json` as input. If a result was wrong, slow or missing, send one `arcmira_feedback`.
